# Playing with Pandas
Lets get our hands dirty with some exploratory data analytics with Pandas! 

__Things we will learn or touch on__

* Pandas
* Plotting Libraries
* Interactive Python Environment - Jupyter Notebook
* Useful data analytics techniques
* Sklearn and Basic machine learning
* Exporting models for web frameworks


### What is a Jupyter Notebook?
see [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)

> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.
